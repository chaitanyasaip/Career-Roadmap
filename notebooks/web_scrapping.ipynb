      "Data Scientist, Engineering & Data Group\n",
      "Do you want to work for a mission-driven non-profit, analyzing data and writing software that will contribute to helping millions of coffee farmers out of poverty? Enveritas is a 501(c)3 non-profit and Y Combinator-backed startup looking to hire a Data Scientist for our Data Team. \n",
      "We are looking for a Data Scientist with extensive professional experience to join our Engineering and Data Group on a remote, full-time basis. This position is open globally, based on locations supported by our EOR partner, Deel. You can learn more about this role at https://www.enveritas.org/jobs/data-scientist.\n",
      "Our Engineering and Data Group is a quirky, talented, and humble group of about twenty with diverse backgrounds ranging from journalism to academia to international industry.\n",
      "About Our Data Team\n",
      "The Data Team's mission is to leverage data analytics to drive Enveritas' efforts in improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers around the world. We are responsible for ensuring that we collect high quality data, we leverage it to generate actionable insights that support smallholder farmers worldwide, and we make the data and insights accessible to other teams, such as the Operations and Partnerships Team.\n",
      "To improve the quality of our data collection process, we create tools to support our Country Operations teams. These tools enable the detection of outliers and automating quality control processes while collecting our survey data. \n",
      "We are also responsible for the transformation of our raw data into insights. This includes writing the code that scores our standards, and creating models that give new insights about smallholder farming. For example, we estimate the cost farmers face when growing coffee to know if they earn a livable income.\n",
      "Our programming languages of choice are Python and SQL (we use PostgreSQL), although some of our analysis is also done in R. We use git for version control, Github for hosting our repositories, and pytest for automated testing. Our internal BI tool is Looker.\n",
      "What You’ll Be Doing\n",
      "Providing technical oversight and mentorship. You will provide technical oversight to the models the Data Team produces. Additionally, you will offer guidance on and document statistical best practices and methodologies, helping to elevate the overall analytical capabilities within the Data Team and the organization.\n",
      "Build models to create new insights from our data. You will identify opportunities for creating models using the data we collect. Engage with the Operations and Partnerships teams to generate ideas for models that would be beneficial for them, and the coffee and cocoa community. This includes using Python to craft these models, incorporating them into our data pipeline, and effectively synthesizing, visualizing, and conveying the results.\n",
      "Serve as internal statistics consultant. Undertake the role of an internal statistical advisor, providing expertise across the organization for all statistics-related matters. This includes aiding teams in developing innovative sampling methods, calculating appropriate sample sizes, interpreting data analysis results, and ensuring the statistical integrity of projects and data collection. \n",
      "Who You Are\n",
      "Our team is fully distributed, so you should be comfortable with remote work. This role is a full-time individual contributor role. While you can be located anywhere, our core hours are 10am to 2pm Eastern Time Monday through Friday, with team members choosing either an early start or later stop as suits them.\n",
      "Our work is often ambiguous, so you should have a love for environments with uncertainty. You should have a deep empathy for users of our tools and understand the importance of supporting the work of other teams. You should also be willing to engage in a broad range of tasks beyond standard data science functions, and you are not afraid of using a simple model that gets the job done.\n",
